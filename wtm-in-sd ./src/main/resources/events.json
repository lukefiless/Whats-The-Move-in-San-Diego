First he’s just going to do this regional production of A Christmas Carol. As the years pass, Eddie finds himself back at the same local theatre, over and over and over again. Much remains the same: the play, the stage manager, the green room — though Eddie finds himself in different costumes as he ages through the male roles over the course of his career. Anna Ouyang Moench’s comedic and moving new play is a love letter to actors, artists and dreamers of all professions who make sacrifices large and small in service of their work… and ultimately wonder whether it was worth it.",
